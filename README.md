Welcome to the Readme section !

All the files present in this repository were used to create a dashboard on Heroku.
The main file for the appearance of the dashboard is "dashboard.py". 
The file "Procfile" informs Heroku that it is with Streamlit that the dashboard will be launched.
The file "requirement.txt" lists the packages to install to make this dashboard.
The file "runtime.text" gives the Python version used.
The file "tests" has the tests that will be executed every time I push a file on this branch (Github Actions).
The files "Pipfile", "Pipfile.lock", "setup.sh" and the folder "src" configurate the dashboard according to my system settings.
